This is a web application I developed while doing The Web Developer Bootcamp course, taught by Colt Steele, through Udemy. The application has been deployed on Heroku and the database on mLab. I used MongoDB, NodeJS, and ExpressJS to develop this, along with Bootstrap, MomentJS, and Geocode for front-end technologies.
